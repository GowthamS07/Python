#Functions are mini-programs in our program
#Print() displays the value passed to it
#input() lets user type in a value
#len() takes a string value & returns an integer value of the string's length
#int(), float(), and str() convert value data types

#Boolean Data Type: True, False
#Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
#== is comparison, = is assignment
#Boolean Operators: and, or, not

#An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False.
#An elif (that is, "else if") statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes if its condition is True and all of the previous conditions have been False.
#An else statement comes at the end. It's block is executed if all of the previous conditions have been False.
#The values 0, 0.0, and the empty string sre considered to be Falsey values. When used in conditions they are considered False. We can always see for ourself which values are Truthy or Falsey by pasing them to the bool() function.
