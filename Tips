#Functions are mini-programs in our program
#Print() displays the value passed to it
#input() lets user type in a value
#len() takes a string value & returns an integer value of the string's length
#int(), float(), and str() convert value data types

#Boolean Data Type: True, False
#Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
#== is comparison, = is assignment
#Boolean Operators: and, or, not

#An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False.
#An elif (that is, "else if") statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes if its condition is True and all of the previous conditions have been False.
#An else statement comes at the end. It's block is executed if all of the previous conditions have been False.
#The values 0, 0.0, and the empty string sre considered to be Falsey values. When used in conditions they are considered False. We can always see for ourself which values are Truthy or Falsey by pasing them to the bool() function.

#When the execution reaches the end of a while statement's block, it jumps back to the start to re-check the condition.
#Press Ctrl+C to interrupt an infinite loop.
#A break statement causes the execution to immediately leave the loop, without re-checking the condition.
#A continue statement causes the execution to immediately jump back to the start of the loop & re-check the condition.

#for loops will loop a specific no. of times.
#The range() function called with one, two, or three arguments.
#break & continue can be used in for loops.

#You can import modules & get access to new functions.
#The modules that come with Python are called the standard library, but you can also install 3rd party modules using the pip tool. e.g. pyperclip.
#The sys.exit() function will immediately quit your program.
#The pyperclip 3rd party module has copy() & paste() functions for reading & writing text to the clipboard.
